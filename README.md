### Pull Request (PR) Process

**How should developers submit a PR (e.g., from a feature branch)?**
Here are links that help you to learn how to make a _pull request_:

- [Basic Git Instructions: Making pull request to the original repository](https://github.com/MuhammadKhalilzadeh/basic-git-instructions?tab=readme-ov-file#making-pull-request-to-the-original-repository)

**What is the preferred branch naming convention (e.g., feature/branch-name, bugfix/branch-name)?**

[Link to a brief description on our naming convention](https://github.com/MuhammadKhalilzadeh/basic-git-instructions?tab=readme-ov-file#checking-out-and-creating-a-new-branch)

Our naming convention for GitHub branches follows a structured and clear format:
`[0-9][0-9][0-9]-[Month]-[Day]-[subject]`.

Here’s a breakdown of its components:
`[0-9][0-9][0-9]`: A three-digit number, which could represent a unique identifier for the branch. It is basically the No. for your branch.

_Note: even if something goes wrong with creating your branch, feel free to delete the branch or create a new one and simply add one more to the counting._

`[Month]`: The abbreviated month name (e.g., Jan, Feb, Mar).
`[Day]`: The day of the month in two digits.
`[subject]`: A brief description of the branch’s purpose or the feature being worked on.

For example, `001-Mar-12-Dashboard` indicates:

`001`: The first branch or a unique identifier, also the first branch you've created.
`Mar`: The month of March.
`12`: The 12th day of the month.
`Dashboard`: The subject or feature being developed.

Note: If it's a bug fix, simply add a `[bug-fix]` before the subject, like this:
`001-Mar-12-bug-fix-Dashboard`

**Should PRs be tied to issues (e.g., "Closes #IssueNumber")?**
Since you'll fork the original repository, therefore you will not be able to tie your branch you the issues, but whenever you're done with the issue, you should ask admins to close the issue after the merge.

### Review Process

**How many reviewers are required to approve a PR before it can be merged?**
At least 1 full-stack developer and 2 developers on the same position/role as yourself, whether you're Frontend or Backend team.

**Who should be responsible for reviewing (e.g., rotating reviewers, assigned leads)?**
Since we're on the beginning of our road, it is better for all of the team members to participate in the process of reviewing the codebase and getting a hands-on experience on how to review the code and find potential bugs, errors, and possible enhancements. Also, it is a must to have at least one of the full-stack developers on the review, since they are the bridge between frontend and backend.
